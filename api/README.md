LOL Imma be real it took me hours to get this to work on my local machine so lets hope that you can also get it to work

To run locally you want to create a local environment and have python installed ensuring that python version is between 3.10-3.12 unfortunately it can be lower or higher since the installed packages will conflict and welp you won't be able to use it

Windows:
python -m venv yourenv

.\yourenv\Scripts\activate

python main.py

Linux:

python -m venv yourenv

source venv/bin/activate

python main.py

Mac: Lol I don't know google it
